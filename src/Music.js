                    <p>Outside of CS, I am hugely passionate about music! I was part of <a href="https://stanfordotone.com">O-Tone</a>, Stanford's East Asian A Cappella group, for a few years in my undergrad. I have my own YouTube channel where I post song covers (mainly of K-Pop),
                        and I enjoy producing my own music using Logic Pro and some fun electronic instruments. I've also taken MUSIC 123E: Electronic Music Composition, where I produced, composed, and recorded vocals for
                        my own EP album. Though piano was my first instrument, I also like to experiment around on a guitar or ukulele whenever I get a chance.</p>
                    <p>Above are some of the songs composed and produced by me!</p>
