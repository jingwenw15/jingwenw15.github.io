                    <p>If there's anything to know about me... I am hugely passionate about music. It's been a part of my life since I can remember, after taking lessons in piano, guitar, and voice throughout my childhood and teenage years. Becoming
                        a professional singer has always been a dream of mine. Maybe it's a little futile now, but I still want to put my creations out there into the universe, so here we are! Self-fulfillment, or something like that...</p>
                 <p>I sang Soprano for <a href="https://stanfordotone.com">O-Tone</a>, Stanford's East Asian A Cappella group, for a few years in my undergrad (although I'm more of a Mezzo). I also have my own YouTube channel where I post song covers (mainly of K-Pop).
                    </p>
                     <p>I enjoy producing my own music, mainly using Logic Pro and some fun electronic instruments. More formally, I've also taken MUSIC 123E: Electronic Music Composition, where I produced, composed, and recorded vocals for
                        my own EP album. </p>
                    <p>Above are some of my songs!</p>
