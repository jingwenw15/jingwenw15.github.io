                    <h1>My all-time favorite songs</h1>  
                    <p>
                        I suppose it's no secret that I love to think about music. Listening carefully for the artistic choices that were made in production
                        and in lyricism comes as second nature now, after I've spent hours on hours poring over my own lyrics and painstakingly tweaking my mixes. 
                        Yet, when asked to provide literary analysis in English class, I often wondered if the authors truly had the intentions that my essays attributed to them while they were using different plot devices. 
                        Now, I believe that it <i>doesn't really matter</i>. After all, art is about
                        the human experience. Perhaps the artists themselves don't even fully know what compelled them to include certain details, but it is the intricacy
                        of the nuances that each artist infuses into their work that makes it beautiful, and whatever meaning an individual derives from another's art 
                        is significant in its own right. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, here is a list of songs that have instilled meaning for me over the years: 
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <u>"Snooze" - Agust D ft. Ryuichi Sakamoto & Woosung of The Rose</u>
                        <p>
                            There is almost too much to say about this song, but at the same time, 
                        everything speaks for itself. Perhaps it is best appreciated after listening to "So Far Away" by Agust D ft. Suran first, as some verses are borrowed 
                        from the previous work. The artist states that this song was written for his juniors in the music industry as a message of hope and perseverance 
                        in a difficult career path, but staying true to my words above, I believe it's applicable to a general human experience. In "So Far Away", Agust D
                        discusses the experience of not having dreams or passions, of feeling as if you're stagnant while watching everyone else steadily chase their goals. 
                        "Snooze" feels like a sequel after many years, where the artist is older, has had time to reflect on having finally found and achieved their dreams,
                        recognizes the countless sacrifices needed, and is hoping to guide others along this road too. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I was younger, "So Far Away" heavily resonated with me, because I kept trying to find my purpose. As the years flew by, I learned that I like creating things - whether that's 
                            writing lyrics, or layering melodies over synth tracks, or coding an app, I love the feeling of breathing life into my work. It is a blessing
                            to call a project your own. And yet, things are not always as simple as having time to drop everything and sit there for hours, interrupted, working
                            on your creations. With life comes necessary responsibilities, and I still struggle with reconciling what I want to do with what has to be done. 
                            For all these reasons, "Snooze" brings me a lot of comfort. The piano backtrack and soft background vocals are a soothing choice, and I have always admired
                            Agust D's ability to communicate strong emotions so clearly: of hopelessness, yearning, and now strength. It's present in all the artistic choices: 
                            the steady but uncomplicated beat, how the song begins as a calm reflection but intensely rises in conviction by the last verse, and Woosung's vocals in 
                            the unchanging chorus that speaks of comfort and faith that despite whatever trials await on your journey, you will be alright. 
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <u>"Fear" - SEVENTEEN</u>
                        <p>
                            I must admit, I strongly admire this song's artistry. It's a difficult task to bring 13 individuals together on a track and present one cohesive story, and 
                            an even more difficult task to have every aspect of the work, from the lyrics to the composition to the production, fit so perfectly in this story. For most songs, I can think of at least one choice
                            I personally would have made differently, whether it's switching an out-of-place instrument or adding an additional chorus. But in "Fear", everything feels so purposeful. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Although the song is under 3 minutes, it still feels complete and 
                            dynamic: each verse, prechorus, and chorus feels different from the predecessor, but still comes as a natural progression in the narrative. The song opens with the chorus,
                            which in this day and age is not surprising given the need to quickly catch the attention of the listener. I'm normally not such a big fan of this choice, but it works 
                            well in this case because of the sheer intensity of the chorus contrasting with the instrumental completely cutting out in the following verse. It is this use of 
                            silence that draws me in: following the first chorus, the instrumental cuts out yet again, leaving only whispery, almost haunting, vocals. Then, the second chorus is followed by 
                            an equally intense post-chorus, which slightly mellows out into my personal favorite part of the song: "keep repeating the same words, the lyrics that can't go beyond you" (translated from Korean).
                            It feels like the calm before the explosive storm that is the last chorus, which is filled with beautifully intense backing vocals and harmonies.

                    <li>
                        <u>"Been Through" - EXO</u>
                        <p>
                            This song is just beautiful. The execution is deceptively simple: a soft backing piano/synth instrumental, a standard steady beat, nothing too musically intricate.
                            But maybe it's the vocal prowess of this group, the pleasantly constructed soothing melody, or the comforting message that makes you realize that music just doesn't have to 
                            be that complicated to be good. The repeated motif in this song is "지나갈 테니", or "it will pass". The lyrics tell a story of someone trying to convince themselves that 
                            "pain is just a passing storm", and that they will shine brightly once they make it through all their hardships. When I listen to this song, I find myself believing it too.

                        <u>"Would've, Could've, Should've" - Taylor Swift</u>
                        <p>
                            The lyricism and composition definitely stand out here. The imagery captures the narrative in a haunting yet effective manner, the rhythm almost feels like a thudding heartbeat, 
                            and the synths blend powerfully with Taylor's voice in the chorus to further amplify this eerie feeling. G major is an interesting choice of key for such a song, and it works masterfully here. 
                            When Taylor sings the same lines two notes higher in the last chorus, it seemed to perfectly capture the feelings of desperation and frustration, along with a spark of resignation, that 
                            had been present throughout the song.  Beautiful vocals as well - in some parts, especially the bridge, it felt like the producers purposefully didn't tune the vocals to be perfectly on pitch,
                            letting the emotion speak for itself. 

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>"借 (Jie)" - Mao Buyi</u>
                        <p>
                            There's something about this song that just perfectly captures melancholy. It's the choice of piano motif in the instrumental, the careful construction of melody, the 
                            poetic lyrics, and the pensive vocals. This is another song where I think each element was chosen perfectly. The song starts and ends with almost whispery vocals, and it really
                            feels like poetry. There's one line that really resonates with me: "借一段往日旋律 婉转悠扬, 把这不能说的轻轻唱", or "borrow a gentle melody from the past, so that what cannot be said can be sung softly".
                            This perfectly encapsulates one reason why music is so universal. I listen to music from different countries, in different languages, most of which I don't speak proficiently. And yet, I can
                            feel the raw emotions from every song even if I can't fully understand the nuances of the lyrics. I can understand that some words are hard to say, but easier to sing. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Something else that makes this song so heartbreaking is that it feels like a plea for an ordinary and calm life. We often applaud grandeur and strive for excitement, but life is hard, for lack of better 
                            words. Hardships are a natural part of human existence, and perhaps we often take the quiet moments for granted - that to have nothing happening may be a blessing in itself.

                        <u>"黄昏 (Sunset)" - Steve Chou</u>
                        <p>
                            I must admit I quite like piano-based tracks. This is another case where I think crescendo is perfectly used, in the way that the melody slowly climbs up during the chorus, and then sets back down, 
                            as if resigned to and crying for a future much worse than the past. The guitar solo at the end of the song is also just brilliant. I also quite like the imagery chosen for this song: the concept of 
                            the sun setting on a past relationship, of an entire summer passing and the heartbreak still not wavering, of driving on a long road singing a never-ending song and reminiscing on bittersweet memories, 
                            of the instrumental just slowly fading out instead of cutting off abruptly; after all, some wounds never fully heal, even with time. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>"Something's Gotta Give" - Camila Cabello</u>
                        <p>
                            There are some songs that I just can't imagine another artist singing. Camila's raspy voice fits perfectly against the piano backing track, and her vocals do the heavy lifting to make this song 
                            so powerful. Again, the track is uncomplicated, but it doesn't need to be. It almost feels too private and raw to listen to, like the kind of inner musings you'd find in a diary. The last chorus feels like
                             a plea, an ultimatum of sorts, and a resigned acceptance; with the ad-libs and slight melody change, it plays perfectly to Camila's strengths of interpreting songs in her own way and infusing them with her own emotions.
