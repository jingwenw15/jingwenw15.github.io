          <h2>Fun</h2>
          <p>Outside of CS, I am hugely passionate about music! I was part of <a href="https://stanfordotone.com">O-Tone</a>, Stanford's East Asian A Cappella group, for a few years in my undergrad. I also have my own YouTube channel, where I post song covers (mainly of K-Pop),
          and enjoy producing my own music using Logic Pro and some fun electronic instruments. I've also taken MUSIC 123E: Electronic Music Composition, where I produced, composed, and recorded vocals for
          my own EP album. Although I've played piano since third grade, I also like to experiment around on a guitar or ukulele whenever I get a chance.</p>
          <p>I've also taken up knitting as a relaxing pastime (and hope to also learn crocheting next)! And although Chinese is my first language, my interest in learning various languages had prompted me to study Spanish for 4 years in high school, and
            also more recently, Korean.
